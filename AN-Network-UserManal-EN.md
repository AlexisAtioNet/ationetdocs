## Overview

ATIOnet is based on the premise that online communications between sites and the web portal are possible, however, it provides solid contingency procedures in the event of a communication error.

The ATIOnet platform is a fleet management service with an innovative and unique market offer. Cloud processing, 100% web-based, multi-user access, data availability and sharing, instant updates, security, automatic back-up and paperwork reduction.

ATIOnet is a web portal for fleet service companies that allows the processing of transactions from any point of sale application through a simple and reliable interface. 

ATIOnet can be installed at any service station with one or multiple fleet service programs. The web portal allows fleet managers full access to their vehicle information.

ATIOnet makes it possible for the fleet manager to operate, monitor, change and edit fleet information in real time.


## Definitions

### Contract 

The contract is the relationship that exists between the network and the client, in which it is guided, for example, if it will be of amount or volume, the price at which the fuel is going to be sold, in which sites it can load, among others.

### Sub account 

Each time an identifier is associated with a vehicle or driver, a sub-account is created. The sub account is definitely who is going to have a current account, the sub account is going to be able to receive deposits of money or product. The rules also impact the sub account.

The sub-accounts are hierarchically dependent on the contract.

### Company

In ATIOnet, the company refers to the company that owns the fleet.

### Identifiers 

The identifier is the physical means used by ATIONet to identify a vehicle or driver. ATIONet supports various types of identification, such as card, tag (ring), chip, ATIONet card, manual entry, barcode and iButton. When an identifier is associated to a Vehicle or Driver, a sub account is created.

### Site 

The Site represents the service station. A site is assigned the terminal and may also have associated Location rules.

### Vehicle 

The vehicles can be associated or grouped by a fleet, they can have associated rules and at the moment of being related with an identifier a sub account is created. They may also have an associated driver.

### Driver 

The Driver is the person who is identified in ATIONet as a driver. If this driver is assigned an identifier, a sub account is created. Drivers may also have associated rules.

### Offline module 

ATIONet's offline module is automatically activated when the service station has no Internet connection and the authorisations cannot be processed online. At this point the offline module comes into play. For the Nano CPI controller it is completely transparent. When the offline module recovers the connectivity it sends all the information processed locally and also lowers the news. As long as there is connectivity, the offline module is continuously downloading ATIONet news (balances, identifiers, rules, etc).

### Terminal

The terminal (or controller) is the representation of the dispenser controller, which needs to be parameterized in a particular way according to the type of terminal. The terminals handled by ATIONet are ATIO-NanoCPI, ATIO-Standalone, ATIO-CG, VF-Standalone, VF-Sapphire, VF-Ruby, ControlGas and OPW-FSC3000. 

### Navigation Menu

ATIOnet has a quick access menu located on the left side of the page. From this menu you can access the different options. The menu is divided into 7 sections. (Dashboard, Favorites, Views, Reports, Inventory, Administration and Logbook)

### Board

The Board is a page where you will have a global vision of the operation of your network. The dashboard has specific widgets that will help you make preventive or corrective decisions according to the information and data they show. The data shown in the Dashboard is real time data. Some of the widgets are automatically refreshed.
These can be removed or added according to the user's needs in the My Preferences window. They can also be placed on the board according to the level of visibility you want to give each one.
The complete list of widgets available for Network subscriptions is as follows:

#### General Status

This widget is very important when starting up the network. This widget gives us information of which parameters we need to configure to be operative. It warns us when, for example, we don't have vehicles or identifications created among other parameters.
This widget can show "Warnings" (yellow icon) when the operation of the network is not in play, but if it shows a red cross indicates that the network is not operational.

![Estado General](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/estadoGeneral.png)
![Estado General](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/estadoGeneral2.png)

#### Liters-Months

The "Liters/Month" indicates the amount of each fuel dispensed in the last month. The last month is the last 30 days from the day of the date. This widget has the ability to filter by Site, City and Fleet. You must select the filter and then enter the value by which it should be filtered. This last field is of the "auto complete" type.

![Litros Mes](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/litrosMes.png)

#### Daily Transactions

This widget contains a pie chart that shows very quickly how many transactions were approved and how many were rejected during the day.

![Transacciones DÃ­a](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/transaccionesDia.png)

#### List of Pending Pre-Authorizations

This list widget displays all preauthorizations that have not yet received the completion transaction. (For more details on the transaction flow refer to this one [document](AN-Transaction_Flows-TechGuide.md).

5. ***Authorized:*** The amount that was authorized in the pre-authorization.
6. ***Pos:*** Position or pump informed by the point of sale or controller.
7. ***Age:*** The time in minutes that this pre-authorization has been in effect.

The pending pre authorizations should be dispatches in progress, if there are records in this widget with a high Age, means that the point of sale or controller did not send the completion transaction or the cancellation transaction in the case that fuel has not been dispatched.

![Pre Auth Pendientes](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/preauthPendientes.png)

#### Transactions marked last month

The following shows all transactions that were rejected by any of the validations made by ATIONet in the authorization process. Either due to lack of balance or rules among other validations. For more details on "Rejected Transactions" refer to this document: [TODO](#todo)

The column ***"Age "*** shows the number of minutes since the last time the terminal was reported. 

![Estado Terminales](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/estadoTerminales1.png)
![Estado Terminales](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/estadoTerminales2.png)

### Favorites

Vehicles, Drivers, Sites and Fleets are entities that may require daily monitoring by certain users. To facilitate this task you can add some of these entities to the list of Favorites. Once entered an entity to this list the access is faster and direct, without the need to enter filters each time you want to search. 

Once inside the Favorites page, by clicking on the link in the "Type" column, you will be redirected to the detailed view of that entity. 

If you want to remove an entity from the list of Favorites, click on the icon on the right with the shape of a cross.

![Favoritos](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/favoritos.png)

### Views

ATIONet has a series of views where you can view information on the operation of the network. ATIONet considers a view to all those screens that besides being able to visualize information, it is also exportable for a post processing. Unlike the [***Reportes***](#reportes) which are screens that display information in a format designed to be printed and saved.
All the views in ATIONet respect a consistency in aesthetics and functionality. All the views have a toolbar with all these functions (or at least some of them).

![Vistas](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/vistas.png) 

1. ***Condensed view:*** This option is active by default when the view is opened, this option shows in the grid the minimum data in a single line.
2. ***Detailed view:*** This option activates a second row in each record within the grid and shows more information from each of the records.
3. ***Print:*** When you click on this option, a new window opens with the data shown in the grid but with a format oriented to be printed, a header is included with the logo that the subscriber configured.
4. ***Export:*** By clicking on this option the information currently displayed in the grid is exported to Excel. An automatic download will start in your browser.
5. ***Update:*** Some views where the frequency of change of information is high, it might be useful to want to refresh the grid. This option refreshes the data immediately.  

Some views also have a filter panel. By default this panel appears collapsed, to display it click on the bar that says "Filters". Each view has specific fields by which you can filter. Once you have entered the desired values press the "Search" button.

![Vistas](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/vistas3.png)

The views also have pagination and the user will be able to define how many records per page are shown. This configuration is done from [***Mis Preferencias***](#mis-preferencias)
The following is the view of ATIONet Vehicles:

![Vistas](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/vistas2.png)

#### Pending Authorizations

Pending authorizations are those transactions that have not yet received the completion transaction. The records seen in this view are shipments that are currently underway. If for some reason there are old pre-authorizations, it is likely that the POS did not send the completion transaction or the cancellation transaction if the shipment was not completed.

Please note that at the time of preauthorization, ATIONet froze the amount of the authorization of the current account of the sub account.
This view presents all the fields necessary to identify the transaction and the vehicle. If you need to see more details, clicking on the authorization code will take you to the transaction details view.

![Autorizaciones Pendientes](Content/Includes/AN-Network-UserManal-SP/autorizacionesPendientes.png)

If old pending transactions appear and you are sure it is not an ongoing shipment, you may cancel them and return the balance to the checking account.
To do this you have 2 ways, individually, by clicking on the "X" icon to the right of the grid or massively by selecting the transactions, displaying the "Batch Actions" menu and selecting "Cancel". This will cancel the transactions and return the balance to each of the current accounts.

![Autorizaciones Pendientes](Content/Includes/AN-Network-UserManal-SP/autorizacionesPendientes2.png)

(for more details on the transaction flow refer to this [documento](AN-Transaction_Flows-TechGuide.md))

#### Drivers

This view lists drivers who have been discharged. You can filter them by name, ID, company, alert rule or status. Also, in the options column to the right, you can choose to assign an ID, edit it, or mark the driver as a favorite.

![Conductores](Content/Includes/AN-Network-UserManal-SP/conductores.png)

#### Merchant Current Accounts

The trade current accounts view is the view where the balances and movements of the trades are consulted.
In ATIONet the term trade refers to the company that owns the sites.

This view has, like the rest of the views, a panel of filters.
The first option in the panel is the type of report we want to see.

![Cuentas Corrientes de Comercio](Content/Includes/AN-Network-UserManal-SP/cuentasCorrientesDeComercio.png)

#### Company Current Accounts

The Company Checking Accounts view is the view where the available sub account balances are consulted (Remember that the sub account is the union between a vehicle/driver and an identifier. For more details on sub-accounts consult: [Esta secciÃ³n](#sub-cuenta)).

In ATIONet the term company refers to the company that owns the fleet. For more details about companies consult: [Esta secciÃ³n](#compaÃ±Ã­a)

This view has, like the rest of the views, a panel of filters.
The first option in the filter panel is the type of report we want to see:

![Cuentas Corrientes](Content/Includes/AN-Network-UserManal-SP/tiposDeCuentasCorrientesDeCompaÃ±ia.PNG)

1. ***List of Contracts:*** This option lists the contracts with their respective balance, but does not give details of the movements, it is a view that summarizes the data of each of the sub-accounts.

	![Cuentas Corrientes](Content/Includes/AN-Network-UserManal-SP/listaDeContratos.png)

2. ***Contract Movements:*** This option lists the sub-accounts with their respective balance, but does not give details of the movements, it is a view that summarizes the data of each of the sub-accounts.

	![Cuentas Corrientes](Content/Includes/AN-Network-UserManal-SP/movimientosDeContratos.png)

3. ***List of Sub-accounts:*** This option lists the sub-accounts with their respective balance, but does not give details of the movements, it is a view that summarizes the data of each of the sub-accounts.

	![Cuentas Corrientes](Content/Includes/AN-Network-UserManal-SP/listaDeSubCuentas.png)

4. ***Sub-accounts Movements:*** This view option shows in detail each of the movements of the sub-account, both credits and debits.   

	![Cuentas Corrientes](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/cuentasCorrientes3.png)

Selecting this second option enables several more filters:

* ***Account Statement:*** Account Statement Number.
* If you enter one or more sub-account names, only the movements of those sub-accounts will be listed. Note that this field is "autocomplete", will be completed as you type, if you press the space bar will show all subaccounts.
* ***Date From / Date To:*** Entering these values will filter the movements between the two dates.
* ***Time From / Time To:*** Entering these values will filter the movements between the two hours.
* ***Amount From / Amount To:*** Entering these values will filter the movements whose amount is between both values.
* ***Species:*** You can filter by species (Product).
* ***Debit / Credit:*** You can select which type of movements you want to see, whether debit or credit.
* ***Type:*** What type of movement generated the movement in the current account
***Origin:***Origin of the movement, whether it is the ATIONet console, a mobile application or a call to the API from a third party application.
* ***Transient Movements:*** Checking this option will show the internal movements generated by ATIONet. For example, each time a balance is frozen after a pre-authorization and a termination transaction is received, ATIONet returns the frozen balance and subsequently debits the final amount reported. The return of the frozen balance is considered a transitory movement and is not shown if this option is not selected.

#### Exceptions

ATIONet separates unauthorized transactions into 2 sections, Exceptions and [Transacciones Rechazadas](#transacciones-rechazadas).
Exceptions are those transactions that did not pass the hard validations of the system or those that are detected as possible frauds.

In the Exceptions view we can filter by Exception type first. The types of Exceptions available are as follows:

![Cuentas Corrientes](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/excepciones2.png)

This view also has the filter panel mentioned above. It is worth highlighting the ***"Offline Transactions "*** filter, by checking this option, it will also show those transactions that were marked as Exceptions in the Offline module. 
(for more details about the Offline module see this [secciÃ³n](#modulo-offline))

![Cuentas Corrientes](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/excepciones4.png)

Once you have selected the filters, press ***"Search "***" and all transactions marked as Exceptions will appear in the list.

Some transactions remain in "Review" status in some situations, such as when more than authorized is sent (due to a controller or POS error). In these cases it is necessary to approve or reject the transaction using one of the two icons to the right of each record.

![Cuentas Corrientes](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/excepciones.png)

#### Transactions

The transaction view is one of the most important in ATIONet. In this view you can see the transactions that were made and approved.

The Filter panel has all these possibilities:

![Transacciones](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/transactions.png)

Once you have selected the desired filter, press ***"Search "*** and it will list the transactions that comply with the filter.

![Transacciones](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/transactions2.png)

The grid shows the main data of the transaction, in the actions column you can ignore a transaction and enter the process of ignorance. (for more details on the ignorance of transactions see this [secciÃ³n](#transacciones-desconocidas)).

If you want to see the transaction detail, click on the Authorization Code, this will take you to a detail view of the transaction.

![Transacciones](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/transactions3.png)

In the Rejected Transactions view we can filter by the type of rejection first. The types of rejections available are as follows:

![Transacciones Rechazadas](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/transaccionesRechazadas.png)

This view also has the filter panel mentioned above. It is worth highlighting the ***"Offline Transactions "*** filter, by checking this option, it will also show those transactions that were marked as rejected in the Offline module. 
(for more details about the Offline module see this [secciÃ³n](#modulo-offline))

![Cuentas Corrientes](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/excepciones4.png)

Once you select the filters, press ***"Search "*** and all transactions marked as rejected will be listed.

![Transacciones Rechazadas](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/transaccionesRechazadas2.png)

It should be clarified that there is a possibility that a transaction may be rejected but that the fuel has been delivered. This occurs when the rejection occurs in the termination transaction.
Some of the most common reasons for this situation are the following:

* The pre authorization is expired (more than 3hs between the date of creation of the pre authorization and the date of creation of the termination. This is not related to the time it may take for the termination to arrive in offline mode).
* There is no existing pre-authorization for that transaction.
* The pre-authorization was cancelled manually.
* The termination transaction contains invalid information (errors in the terminal or controller).
* The termination transaction was executed with errors on the host.
* The termination transaction contains different information than the pre-authorization information, such as for example.
* The termination transaction reports more volume or amount than was authorized. In this case the authorization can be approved.

#### Uncontrolled Transactions

Uncontrolled transactions are those transactions that are generated because the controller detects a difference in gauges and sends a transaction for the difference. These transactions do not contain data about the identifier since they were generated automatically and were not initiated with the presentation of an identifier. As they do not have an identifier assigned, they are not impacted in any current account nor do they count for the calculation of rules.
