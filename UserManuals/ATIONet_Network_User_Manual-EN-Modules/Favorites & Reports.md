# Favorites

Vehicles, Drivers, Sites and Fleets are entities that may require daily monitoring by certain users. To facilitate this task you can add some of these sections to the list of **Favorites**. Once entered a section to this list, the access is faster and direct, without the need to enter filters each time you want to search.

Once inside the Favorites page, by clicking on the link in the **Type** column, you will be redirected to the detailed view of that section.

If you want to remove a section from the list of Favorites, click on the icon on the right side with the shape of a cross.
