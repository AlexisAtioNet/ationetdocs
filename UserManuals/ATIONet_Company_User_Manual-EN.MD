# Overview

ATIONet is based on the premise that online communications between sites and the web portal are possible, however, it provides solid contingency procedures in the event of a communication error.

The ATIONet platform is a fleet management service with an innovative and unique market offer. Cloud processing, 100% web-based, multi-user access, data availability and sharing, instant updates, security, automatic back-up and paperwork reduction.

ATIONet is a web portal for fleet service companies that allows the processing of transactions from any point of sale application through a simple and reliable interface. 

ATIONet can be installed at any service station with one or multiple fleet service programs. The web portal allows fleet managers full access to their vehicle information.

ATIONet makes it possible for the fleet manager to operate, monitor, change and edit fleet information in real time.


# Definitions

## Contract 

The contract is the relationship that exists between the network and the client, in which it is guided, for example, if it will be of amount or volume, the price at which the fuel is going to be sold, in which sites it can load, among others.

## Sub-account 

Each time an identification is associated with a vehicle or driver, a sub-account is created. The sub-account is definitely who is going to have a current account, the sub-account is going to be able to receive deposits of money or product. The rules also impact the sub-account.

The sub-accounts are hierarchically dependent on the contract.

## Company

In ATIONet the company refers to the entity that owns the fleet. It is the one that manages the vehicles, drivers and fleet rules.

## Identification

The identification is the physical means used by ATIONet to identify a vehicle or driver. ATIONet supports various types of identifications, such as card, TAG, chip, ATIONet card, manual entry, barcode and iButton. When an identification is associated to a Vehicle or Driver, a sub-account is created.

## Site 

The Site represents the service station. A site is assigned a terminal/controller and may also have associated Location rules.

## Vehicle 

The vehicles can be associated or grouped by a fleet, they can have associated rules and at the moment of being related with an identification a sub-account is created. They may also have an associated driver.

## Driver 

The driver in ATIONet is the person who is identified as a chauffeur. If this driver is assigned an identification, a sub-account is created. Drivers may also have associated rules.

## Offline module 

ATIONet's offline module is automatically activated when the service station has no Internet connection and the authorizations cannot be processed online. At this point the offline module comes into play. For the terminal/controller it is completely transparent. When the offline module recovers the connectivity it sends all the information processed locally and also downloads any updates. As long as there is connectivity, the offline module is continuously downloading ATIONet updates (balances, identifications, rules, etc).

## Terminal

The terminal (or controller) is the representation of the dispenser controller, which needs to be parameterized in a particular way according to the type of terminal. The terminals handled by ATIONet are ATIO-NanoCPI, ATIO-Standalone, ATIO-CG, VF-Sapphire, VF-Commander, VF-Ruby, ControlGas, among others. 

# Navigation Menu

ATIONet has a quick access menu located on the left side of the website. From this menu you can access different options. The menu is divided into 9 sections. (Dashboard, Favorites, Reports, Administration, Fleets, Billing, Notifications, Configuration and Logbook).

# Dashboard

The Board is a page where you will have a global vision of the operation of your network. The dashboard has specific widgets that will help you make preventive or corrective decisions according to the information and data they show. The data shown in the Dashboard is real time data and some of the widgets are automatically refreshed.
These can be removed or added according to the user's needs in the **My Preferences** option. They can also be placed on the board according to the level of visibility you want to give each one.
The complete list of widgets available for Network subscriptions is as follows:

## Health Status

This widget is very important when starting up the network. This widget gives us information of which parameters we need to configure to be operative. It warns us when, for example, we don't have vehicles or identifications created among other parameters.
This widget can show **Warnings** (yellow icon) when the operation of the network is not in play, but if it shows a red cross indicates that the network is not operational.

![Health Status](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Dashboard/Health%20Status.PNG)

## Units/Months

The "Units/Month" indicates the amount of each fuel dispensed in the last month. The last month is the last 30 days from the day of the date. This widget has the ability to filter by Site, City and Fleet. You must select the filter and then enter the value by which it should be filtered. This last field is of the "auto complete" type.

![Units/Months](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Dashboard/Units-Months.PNG)

## Todayâ€™s Transactions

This widget contains a pie chart that shows very quickly how many transactions were approved and how many were rejected during the day.

## List of Outstanding Pre-Authorizations

This list widget displays all pre-authorizations that have not yet received the completion transaction. (For more details on the transaction flow refer to this one [document]( https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/AN-Transaction_Flows-TechGuide.md)).

This shows 7 columns:

1. **Authorization Code:** The authorization code assigned to the transaction.
2. **Company:** The company to which the vehicle in question belongs.
3. **SubAccount:** The subaccount that requested the pre-authorization.
4. **Site:** The site where the transaction took place.
5. **Authorized:** The amount that was authorized in the pre-authorization.
6. **Pos:** Position or pump informed by the point of sale or controller.
7. **Age:** The time in minutes that this pre-authorization has been in effect.

The pending pre-authorizations should be dispatches in progress, if there are records in this widget with a high Age, means that the point of sale or controller did not send the completion transaction or the cancellation transaction in the case that fuel has not been dispatched.

## Declined Transactions
ATIONet separates unauthorized transactions into 2 sections: [Exceptions](#exceptions) and **Declined Transactions**.

Declined Transactions are those that managed to pass ATIONet's hard authentications, but were rejected by other validations such as an unsatisfied rule or balance validation.

![Declined Transactions](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Declined%20Transactions.PNG)

In this view, at the start you can filter by the type of rejection. The types of rejections available are as follows:

![Declined Transactions Filters](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Declined%20Transactions%20Filters.PNG)

## Dispensed Transactions
In this section you can view all transactions that had fuel dispensed.

![Dispensed Transactions](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Dispensed%20Transactions.PNG)

## Disputed Transactions
Disputed transactions are those that either party (Merchant or Company) claims to be unaware of.

In this section you can consult the disputed transactions, listed by code, date, reason, state, transaction number, company, site. There is also the commentary of the company, the merchant and the network.

![Disputed Transactions](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Disputed%20Transactions.PNG)

## Exceptions
ATIONet separates unauthorized transactions into 2 sections: **Exceptions** and [Declined transactions](#declined-transactions). Exceptions are those transactions that did not pass the hard validations of the system or those that are detected as possible frauds.

![Exceptions](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Exceptions.PNG)

In this view, at the start you can filter by the type of exception. The types of exceptions available are as follows:

![Exceptions Filters](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Exceptions%20Filters.PNG)

Some transactions remain in **Review** status in some situations, such as when more than authorized is sent (due to a controller or POS error). In these cases it is necessary to approve or reject the transaction using one of the two icons to the right of each record.

## Fast Track Configuration
A Fast Track in ATIONet is a way to configure a one-use-only authorization for an specific amount to an already existing fleet sub-account. In this sections you can configure up to 10 Custom Fields for Fast Tracks.

![Fast Track Configuration](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Fast%20Track%20Configuration.PNG)

When you have finished filling in the fields, click the **Save** button.

## Outstanding Authorizations
In ATIONet outstanding authorizations are those transactions that have not yet received the completion transaction, but have been pre-authorized. The information seen in this view are dispatches that are currently underway. If for some reason there are old pre-authorizations, it is likely that the POS did not send the completion transaction or the cancellation transaction if the dispatch was not completed.

Please note that at the time of pre-authorization, ATIONet froze the amount of the authorization of the current account for the sub-account associated. This view presents all the fields necessary to identify the transaction and the sub-account. If you need to see more details, clicking on the authorization code will take you to the transaction details view.

![Outstanding Authorization](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Outstanding%20Authorization.PNG)

If old pending transactions appear and you are sure it is not an ongoing dispatch, you may cancel them and return the balance to the current account.
To do so there are 2 ways: individually, by clicking on the **X** icon to the right side of the grid, or massively by selecting the transactions, displaying the **Batch Actions** menu and selecting **Cancel**. This will cancel the transactions and return the balance reserved to each of the current accounts. (for more details on the transaction flow refer to this [document](AN-Transaction_Flows-TechGuide.md))


## Requested Identifications

From this section you will be able to confirm receipt of requests for identifiers made, to complete the request process. Please note that the only orders you can confirm are those that have already been marked as **Delivered**.
To change the status of the requested badges, click the **Bulk Action** button and select the option **Confirm badge delivery**.
