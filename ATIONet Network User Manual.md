# Overview

ATIONet is based on the premise that online communications between sites and the web portal are possible, however, it provides solid contingency procedures in the event of a communication error.

The ATIONet platform is a fleet management service with an innovative and unique market offer. Cloud processing, 100% web-based, multi-user access, data availability and sharing, instant updates, security, automatic back-up and paperwork reduction.

ATIONet is a web portal for fleet service companies that allows the processing of transactions from any point of sale application through a simple and reliable interface. 

ATIONet can be installed at any service station with one or multiple fleet service programs. The web portal allows fleet managers full access to their vehicle information.

ATIONet makes it possible for the fleet manager to operate, monitor, change and edit fleet information in real time.


# Definitions

## Contract 

The contract is the relationship that exists between the network and the client, in which it is guided, for example, if it will be of amount or volume, the price at which the fuel is going to be sold, in which sites it can load, among others.

## Sub-account 

Each time an identification is associated with a vehicle or driver, a sub-account is created. The sub-account is definitely who is going to have a current account, the sub-account is going to be able to receive deposits of money or product. The rules also impact the sub-account.

The sub-accounts are hierarchically dependent on the contract.

## Company

In ATIONet the company refers to the entity that owns the fleet. It is the one that manages the vehicles, drivers and fleet rules.

## Identification

The identification is the physical means used by ATIONet to identify a vehicle or driver. ATIONet supports various types of identifications, such as card, TAG, chip, ATIONet card, manual entry, barcode and iButton. When an identification is associated to a Vehicle or Driver, a sub-account is created.

## Site 

The Site represents the service station. A site is assigned a terminal/controller and may also have associated Location rules.

## Vehicle 

The vehicles can be associated or grouped by a fleet, they can have associated rules and at the moment of being related with an identification a sub-account is created. They may also have an associated driver.

## Driver 

The driver in ATIONet is the person who is identified as a chauffeur. If this driver is assigned an identification, a sub-account is created. Drivers may also have associated rules.

## Offline module 

ATIONet's offline module is automatically activated when the service station has no Internet connection and the authorizations cannot be processed online. At this point the offline module comes into play. For the terminal/controller it is completely transparent. When the offline module recovers the connectivity it sends all the information processed locally and also downloads any updates. As long as there is connectivity, the offline module is continuously downloading ATIONet updates (balances, identifications, rules, etc).

## Terminal

The terminal (or controller) is the representation of the dispenser controller, which needs to be parameterized in a particular way according to the type of terminal. The terminals handled by ATIONet are ATIO-NanoCPI, ATIO-Standalone, ATIO-CG, VF-Sapphire, VF-Commander, VF-Ruby, ControlGas, among others. 

# Navigation Menu

ATIONet has a quick access menu located on the left side of the website. From this menu you can access different options. The menu is divided into 9 sections. (Dashboard, Favorites, Reports, Administration, Fleets, Billing, Notifications, Configuration and Logbook).

## Dashboard

The Board is a page where you will have a global vision of the operation of your network. The dashboard has specific widgets that will help you make preventive or corrective decisions according to the information and data they show. The data shown in the Dashboard is real time data and some of the widgets are automatically refreshed.
These can be removed or added according to the user's needs in the **My Preferences** option. They can also be placed on the board according to the level of visibility you want to give each one.
The complete list of widgets available for Network subscriptions is as follows:

### Health Status

This widget is very important when starting up the network. This widget gives us information of which parameters we need to configure to be operative. It warns us when, for example, we don't have vehicles or identifications created among other parameters.
This widget can show **Warnings** (yellow icon) when the operation of the network is not in play, but if it shows a red cross indicates that the network is not operational.

![Health Status](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Dashboard/Health%20Status.PNG)

### Units/Months

The "Units/Month" indicates the amount of each fuel dispensed in the last month. The last month is the last 30 days from the day of the date. This widget has the ability to filter by Site, City and Fleet. You must select the filter and then enter the value by which it should be filtered. This last field is of the "auto complete" type.

![Units/Months](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Dashboard/Units-Months.PNG)

### Today’s Transactions

This widget contains a pie chart that shows very quickly how many transactions were approved and how many were rejected during the day.

![Today’s Transactions](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Dashboard/Today%E2%80%99s%20Transactions.PNG)

### List of Outstanding Pre-Authorizations

This list widget displays all pre-authorizations that have not yet received the completion transaction. (For more details on the transaction flow refer to this one [document]( https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/AN-Transaction_Flows-TechGuide.md)).

This shows 7 columns:

1. **Authorization Code:** The authorization code assigned to the transaction.
2. **Company:** The company to which the vehicle in question belongs.
3. **SubAccount:** The subaccount that requested the pre-authorization.
4. **Site:** The site where the transaction took place.
5. **Authorized:** The amount that was authorized in the pre-authorization.
6. **Pos:** Position or pump informed by the point of sale or controller.
7. **Age:** The time in minutes that this pre-authorization has been in effect.

The pending pre-authorizations should be dispatches in progress, if there are records in this widget with a high Age, means that the point of sale or controller did not send the completion transaction or the cancellation transaction in the case that fuel has not been dispatched.

This shows all sub-accounts that have something to pay attention to, such as:

1. **Without Identifications:** These are vehicles or drivers that do not have an associated identifier.
2. **With inactive Identification:** Are sub-accounts that have an associated identification that has been deactivated from the portal.
3. **With Suspended Identification:** Sub-accounts that have an identification that has been suspended. **Only ATIONet can suspend an identification**.

For example, each time a balance is frozen after a pre-authorization and a termination transaction is received, ATIONet returns the frozen balance and subsequently debits the final amount reported. The return of the frozen balance is considered a transitory movement and is not shown if this option is not selected.

The contingencies are the transactions that were made without a pre-authorization, either because the terminal was off-line or because it did not have one.

![Contingencia](Content/Includes/AN-Network-UserManal-SP/contingencias.png)

To create a new contingency, click on the "New" button.

### Declined Transactions
ATIONet separates unauthorized transactions into 2 sections, [Excepciones](#excepciones)and Rejected Transactions.
Rejected Transactions are those transactions that managed to pass ATIONet's hard validations but were rejected by other validations such as an unsatisfied rule or balance validation.

In the Rejected Transactions view we can filter by the type of rejection first. The types of rejections available are as follows:

![Transacciones Rechazadas](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/transaccionesRechazadas.png)

This view also has the filter panel mentioned above. It is worth highlighting the ***"Offline Transactions "*** filter, by checking this option, it will also show those transactions that were marked as rejected in the Offline module. 
(for more details about the Offline module see this [sección](#modulo-offline))

![Cuentas Corrientes](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/excepciones4.png)

Once you select the filters, press ***"Search "*** and all transactions marked as rejected will be listed.

![Transacciones Rechazadas](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/transaccionesRechazadas2.png)

It should be clarified that there is a possibility that a transaction may be rejected but that the fuel has been delivered. This occurs when the rejection occurs in the termination transaction.
Some of the most common reasons for this situation are the following:

* The pre authorization is expired (more than 3hs between the date of creation of the pre authorization and the date of creation of the termination. This is not related to the time it may take for the termination to arrive in offline mode).
* There is no existing pre-authorization for that transaction.
* The pre-authorization was cancelled manually.
* The termination transaction contains invalid information (errors in the terminal or controller).
* The termination transaction was executed with errors on the host.
* The termination transaction contains different information than the pre-authorization information, such as for example.
* The termination transaction reports more volume or amount than was authorized. In this case the authorization can be approved.

### Dispensed Transactions
### Disputed Transactions
Disputed transactions are those that either party (Commerce or Company) claims to be unaware of.

In this section you can consult the disputed transactions, listed by code, date, reason, state, transaction number, company, trade, site. There is also the commentary of the company, the trade and the network.

To make queries easier, this section has a panel of filters at the top.

![Transacciones Desconocidas](Content/Includes/AN-Network-UserManal-SP/transaccionesDesconocidas.png)

### Exceptions
ATIONet separates unauthorized transactions into 2 sections, Exceptions and [Transacciones Rechazadas](#transacciones-rechazadas).
Exceptions are those transactions that did not pass the hard validations of the system or those that are detected as possible frauds.

In the Exceptions view we can filter by Exception type first. The types of Exceptions available are as follows:

![Cuentas Corrientes](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/excepciones2.png)

This view also has the filter panel mentioned above. It is worth highlighting the ***"Offline Transactions "*** filter, by checking this option, it will also show those transactions that were marked as Exceptions in the Offline module. 
(for more details about the Offline module see this [sección](#modulo-offline))

![Cuentas Corrientes](Content/Includes/AN-HomeBase-UserManal-SP/excepciones4.png)

Once you have selected the filters, press ***"Search "***" and all transactions marked as Exceptions will appear in the list.

Some transactions remain in "Review" status in some situations, such as when more than authorized is sent (due to a controller or POS error). In these cases it is necessary to approve or reject the transaction using one of the two icons to the right of each record.

### Merchant Current Accounts
The trade current accounts view is the view where the balances and movements of the trades are consulted.
In ATIONet the term trade refers to the company that owns the sites.

This view has, like the rest of the views, a panel of filters.
The first option in the panel is the type of report we want to see.

![Cuentas Corrientes de Comercio](Content/Includes/AN-Network-UserManal-SP/cuentasCorrientesDeComercio.png)

### Outstanding Authorizations
Pending authorizations are those transactions that have not yet received the completion transaction. The records seen in this view are dispatched that are currently underway. If for some reason there are old pre-authorizations, it is likely that the POS did not send the completion transaction or the cancellation transaction if the dispatch was not completed.

Please note that at the time of pre-authorization, ATIONet froze the amount of the authorization of the current account of the sub-account.
This view presents all the fields necessary to identify the transaction and the vehicle. If you need to see more details, clicking on the authorization code will take you to the transaction details view.

![Autorizaciones Pendientes](Content/Includes/AN-Network-UserManal-SP/autorizacionesPendientes.png)

If old pending transactions appear and you are sure it is not an ongoing dispatch, you may cancel them and return the balance to the current account.
To do this you have 2 ways, individually, by clicking on the **X** icon to the right side of the grid, or massively by selecting the transactions, displaying the **Batch Actions** menu and selecting "Cancel". This will cancel the transactions and return the balance to each of the current accounts.

![Autorizaciones Pendientes](Content/Includes/AN-Network-UserManal-SP/autorizacionesPendientes2.png)

### Uncontrolled Transactions

Uncontrolled transactions are those transactions that are generated because the controller detects a difference in gauges and sends a transaction for the difference. These transactions do not contain data about the identifier since they were generated automatically and were not initiated with the presentation of an identifier. As they do not have an identifier assigned, they are not impacted in any current account nor do they count for the calculation of rules.
This view also filters panel to make more specific searches.
