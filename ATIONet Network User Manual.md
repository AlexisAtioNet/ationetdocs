# Overview

ATIONet is based on the premise that online communications between sites and the web portal are possible, however, it provides solid contingency procedures in the event of a communication error.

The ATIONet platform is a fleet management service with an innovative and unique market offer. Cloud processing, 100% web-based, multi-user access, data availability and sharing, instant updates, security, automatic back-up and paperwork reduction.

ATIONet is a web portal for fleet service companies that allows the processing of transactions from any point of sale application through a simple and reliable interface. 

ATIONet can be installed at any service station with one or multiple fleet service programs. The web portal allows fleet managers full access to their vehicle information.

ATIONet makes it possible for the fleet manager to operate, monitor, change and edit fleet information in real time.


# Definitions

## Contract 

The contract is the relationship that exists between the network and the client, in which it is guided, for example, if it will be of amount or volume, the price at which the fuel is going to be sold, in which sites it can load, among others.

## Sub-account 

Each time an identification is associated with a vehicle or driver, a sub-account is created. The sub-account is definitely who is going to have a current account, the sub-account is going to be able to receive deposits of money or product. The rules also impact the sub-account.

The sub-accounts are hierarchically dependent on the contract.

## Company

In ATIONet the company refers to the entity that owns the fleet. It is the one that manages the vehicles, drivers and fleet rules.

## Identification

The identification is the physical means used by ATIONet to identify a vehicle or driver. ATIONet supports various types of identifications, such as card, TAG, chip, ATIONet card, manual entry, barcode and iButton. When an identification is associated to a Vehicle or Driver, a sub-account is created.

## Site 

The Site represents the service station. A site is assigned a terminal/controller and may also have associated Location rules.

## Vehicle 

The vehicles can be associated or grouped by a fleet, they can have associated rules and at the moment of being related with an identification a sub-account is created. They may also have an associated driver.

## Driver 

The driver in ATIONet is the person who is identified as a chauffeur. If this driver is assigned an identification, a sub-account is created. Drivers may also have associated rules.

## Offline module 

ATIONet's offline module is automatically activated when the service station has no Internet connection and the authorizations cannot be processed online. At this point the offline module comes into play. For the terminal/controller it is completely transparent. When the offline module recovers the connectivity it sends all the information processed locally and also downloads any updates. As long as there is connectivity, the offline module is continuously downloading ATIONet updates (balances, identifications, rules, etc).

## Terminal

The terminal (or controller) is the representation of the dispenser controller, which needs to be parameterized in a particular way according to the type of terminal. The terminals handled by ATIONet are ATIO-NanoCPI, ATIO-Standalone, ATIO-CG, VF-Sapphire, VF-Commander, VF-Ruby, ControlGas, among others. 

# Navigation Menu

ATIONet has a quick access menu located on the left side of the website. From this menu you can access different options. The menu is divided into 9 sections. (Dashboard, Favorites, Reports, Administration, Fleets, Billing, Notifications, Configuration and Logbook).

![Declined Transactions Filters](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Declined%20Transactions%20Filters.PNG)

## Dispensed Transactions


## Disputed Transactions
Disputed transactions are those that either party (Merchant or Company) claims to be unaware of.

In this section you can consult the disputed transactions, listed by code, date, reason, state, transaction number, company, site. There is also the commentary of the company, the merchant and the network.

![Disputed Transactions](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Disputed%20Transactions.PNG)

## Exceptions
ATIONet separates unauthorized transactions into 2 sections: **Exceptions** and [Declined transactions](#declined-transactions). Exceptions are those transactions that did not pass the hard validations of the system or those that are detected as possible frauds.

![Exceptions](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Exceptions.PNG)

In this view, at the start you can filter by the type of exception. The types of exceptions available are as follows:

![Exceptions Filters](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Exceptions%20Filters.PNG)

Some transactions remain in **Review** status in some situations, such as when more than authorized is sent (due to a controller or POS error). In these cases it is necessary to approve or reject the transaction using one of the two icons to the right of each record.

## Fast Track Configuration
A Fast Track in ATIONet is a way to configure a one-use-only authorization for an specific amount to an already existing fleet sub-account. In this sections you can configure up to 10 Custom Fields for Fast Tracks.

![Fast Track Configuration](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Fast%20Track%20Configuration.PNG)

## Fraud Alerts
Inside this section you can see a list of all frauds performed by the Network. To configure how/when to alert of fraud, go to [Fraud Alerts Configuration](#fraud-alerts-configuration).

![Fraud Alerts](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Fraud%20Alerts.PNG)

## Fraud Alerts Configuration
In this section you can consult and configure how and when are fraud alerts triggered for the Network.

## Generation of Vouchers
## Invoice Type
## Invoices
## Merchants Contracts
In ATIONet the term merchant refers to the entity that owns the sites. In this section you can consult, edit and create merchant contracts.

![Merchant Contracts](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Merchant%20Contracts.PNG)

To create a merhcant contract, click the **New** button.

![Merchant Contract New](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Merchant%20Contracts%20New.PNG)

The fields to be completed are as follows:

* **Code**: Input the code of the contract.
* **Automatically Generated:** Checkmark this option to have ATIONet automatically generate the contract code.
* **Description**: Input the description of the contract.
* **Merchant**: Select the merchant assocciated to the contract.

## Merchant Current Accounts
The merchant current accounts view is where the balances and movements of all merchant are consulted.

For easier quieries there is a filter panel available and the first option in the panel is the type of report to see (Contracts List, Contracts Movements, Sites List and Sites Movements).

![Merchant Current Accounts](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Merchant%20Current%20Accounts.PNG)

## Outstanding Authorizations
In ATIONet outstanding authorizations are those transactions that have not yet received the completion transaction, but have been pre-authorized. The information seen in this view are dispatches that are currently underway. If for some reason there are old pre-authorizations, it is likely that the POS did not send the completion transaction or the cancellation transaction if the dispatch was not completed.

Please note that at the time of pre-authorization, ATIONet froze the amount of the authorization of the current account for the sub-account associated. This view presents all the fields necessary to identify the transaction and the sub-account. If you need to see more details, clicking on the authorization code will take you to the transaction details view.

![Outstanding Authorization](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Outstanding%20Authorization.PNG)

If old pending transactions appear and you are sure it is not an ongoing dispatch, you may cancel them and return the balance to the current account.
To do so there are 2 ways: individually, by clicking on the **X** icon to the right side of the grid, or massively by selecting the transactions, displaying the **Batch Actions** menu and selecting **Cancel**. This will cancel the transactions and return the balance reserved to each of the current accounts. (for more details on the transaction flow refer to this [document](AN-Transaction_Flows-TechGuide.md))

## Over Limit
In this section you can consult or create over limits for company contracts. Over limit in ATIONet refers to an amount that sub-accounts can overextend from their balances.

### Uncontrolled Transactions

Uncontrolled transactions are those transactions that are generated because the controller detects a difference in gauges and sends a transaction for the difference. These transactions do not contain data about the identifier since they were generated automatically and were not initiated with the presentation of an identifier. As they do not have an identifier assigned, they are not impacted in any current account nor do they count for the calculation of rules.
This view also filters panel to make more specific searches.
